# Nano Stores Form

A tiny form library for [Nano Stores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores).

- **Small**. The core is only 350 bytes.
- **Phenomenal performance**. Only rerenders those fields that got updates.
- **Nano Stores first**. Finally, have your form logic *outside* of components. 
Plays nicely with [store events](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores#store-events),
[computed stores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores#computed-stores),
[remote queries](https://github.com/nanostores/query), and the rest.
- **UI agnostic**. Use native `<form>`, any UI kit, React Native, or any mix of them.
- **Unbeatable TS support**. Very strict typing of nested fields, so you don't
waste time debugging.

## Install

```sh
npm install nanostores @nanostores/form
```

## Usage

See [Nano Stores docs](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores#guide) about using the store and subscribing to storeâ€™s changes in UI frameworks.

Nanoform provides you with a couple of helpers. Let's go one by one.

### `nanoform` and `$form.getField`

The core is the form store and its initial shape. `nanoform` returns a [`deepMap`](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores#deep-maps) from the Nano Stores standard exports.

```tsx
import { nanoform } from '@nanostores/form';

export const $authForm = nanoform<{email1?: string, email2?: string, password?: string}>({});

const AuthForm = () => {
  const { email1, email2, password } = useStore($authForm);

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="email"
        value={email1}
        onChange={e => $authForm.setKey('email1', e.currentTarget.value)} />
        {/* render email2, password */}
    </>
  );
};
```

Here you go. You can already use this store in the UI. But it has a few issues:

1. it will rerender the whole form like crazy on each keystroke! Sometimes it's fine, but most of the time it's not.
2. also, it'd be good to have some decent validation of the `email1` and `email2` equality.

Here comes the core helper: `.getField`. It's a strictly typed function which gets the object path to the field and returns a _stable_ store for this field. Stable means that it won't change its identity if you call this function many times with the same key.

The return is just another `deepMap`, so it works with everything Nano Stores provides you with (lifecycles, `computed`, etc.).

The most magical part is that its value is synced with the parent form, so whenever any of them changes, the other changes as well.

Let's add a simple check if emails are the same.

```tsx
import { computed } from 'nanostores';

// Will only recalc when these two fields change
// You can use the same approach to run schema validation on the whole form data
// or just a subtree of it.
const $emailsAreSame = computed(
  [$authForm.getField("email1"), $authForm.getField("email2")],
  (email1, email2) => email1 === email2
);

  // Will only rerender when this field is touched
const Email1 = () => {
  const $field = $authForm.getField("email1");
  return (
    <input
      type="email"
      value={useStore($field)}
      onChange={(e) => $field.set(e.currentTarget.value)}
    />
  );
};
```

### `withOnChange`

This is the second most important helper. Just wrap your form with this function to get a stable identity `onChange` callback added to your fields:

```tsx
import { nanoform, withOnChange, formatDate, FieldStoreWithOnChange } from "@nanostores/form";
import { useStore } from "@nanostores/react";

const $form = withOnChange(
  nanoform<{ str?: string; dt?: Date; num?: number; agreed?: boolean }>({})
);

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Input type="text" $field={$form.getField("str")} />
      <Input type="date" $field={$form.getField("dt")} />
      <Input type="number" $field={$form.getField("num")} />
      <Input type="checkbox" $field={$form.getField("num")} />
    </>
  );
};

const Input = ({
  $field,
  type,
}: {
  $field: FieldStoreWithOnChange;
  type: JSX.IntrinsicElements["input"]["type"];
}) => {
  const value = useStore($field);
  return (
    <input
      type={type}
      value={type === "date" ? formatDate(value as Date) : value}
      onChange={$field.onChange}
    />
  );
};
```

The neat thing is that it will use `value`, `valueAsNumber`, `valueAsDate` and `checked` based on the type this input has. So you'll get the value casted to the correct type completely automatically by the browser.

### `withOnSubmit`

What form goes without a `<form>`, am I right?

This helper is very simple. It adds a stable `onSubmit` to your form store that prevents the default action, makes sure you can't submit the form multiple times, and executes the provided callback with store's data and event (just in case). It plays really nice with [`@nanostores/query` mutations](https://github.com/nanostores/query#createmutatorstore):

```tsx
type AuthData = { email?: string; password?: string; agreed?: boolean };

const $signup = createMutationStore<AuthData>(async ({ data }) => {
  // I'll leave this to reader's imagination
});

const $form = withOnSubmit(
  withOnChange(nanoform<AuthData>({})),
  $signup.mutate
);

const Signup = () => {
  const { loading, error } = useStore($signup);

  return (
    <form onSubmit={$form.onSubmit}>
      <Input type="email" $field={$form.getField("email")} />
      <Input type="date" $field={$form.getField("password")} />
      <Input type="checkbox" $field={$form.getField("agreed")} />

      <button disabled={loading}>Sign up</button>
      {error && <p>Something terrible happened</p>}
    </form>
  );
};
```
